Sync my repository in your root working folder (ie: jbaokp):

    repo init -u https://github.com/IAmTheOneTheyCallNeo/platform_manifest.git -b jb

then:

    repo sync

After sync, type the following commands to remove these two files:

    rm device/htc/vigor/overlay/packages/apps/Settings/res/values/config.xml
    rm device/htc/vigor/overlay/packages/apps/Torch/res/values/config.xml

Please take note that removing this xml may cause you to lose building the torch.apk
and you wil need to pull it from any available rom if you want a working torch icon. 
Any ICS or JB AOSP rom will do. This is necessary for the moment to allow it to build
and I'm too lazy right now to modify the line in it to allow build :P

Go into your "build" directory:

    cd build

edit envsetup.sh and change:

    arm) toolchaindir=arm/arm-linux-androideabi-4.6/bin

to:

    arm) toolchaindir=linaro/bin

Now go back to your root working folder and build your setup:

    . build/envsetup.sh

Then initiate the following commands one by one by typing them in and hitting enter after each:

    make clean
    make clobber
    make installclean

Have some lunch:

    lunch

select option 37 and hit enter then wait a minute.

Was it good?

Now build the rom:

    brunch vigor
