Sync my repository in your root working folder (ie: jbaokp):

    repo init -u https://github.com/IAmTheOneTheyCallNeo/platform_manifest.git -b jb

then:

    repo sync

After sync, type the following commands to remove these two files:

    rm device/htc/vigor/overlay/packages/apps/Settings/res/values/config.xml
    rm device/htc/vigor/overlay/packages/apps/Torch/res/values/config.xml

Go into your "build" directory:

    cd build

edit envsetup.sh and change:

    
to:

    arm) toolchaindir=linaro/bin

Now go back to your root working folder and build your setup:

    . build/envsetup.sh

Then initiate the following commands one by one by typing them in and hitting enter after each:

    make clean
    make clobber
    make installclean

Now build the rom:

    brunch vigor
